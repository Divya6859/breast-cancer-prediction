# Breast Cancer Prediction

**Description:**  
Classify tumors as benign or malignant using Python and Machine Learning models.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

**Project Overview:**  
Classify tumors using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model building, evaluation, and predictive system.

**Workflow:**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature scaling and train-test split  
- Logistic Regression & SVM model building and evaluation  
- Predictive system for new patient data  

**Highlights:**  
- End-to-end workflow  
- Visualizations to understand feature relationships  
- Predict tumor type for new data
